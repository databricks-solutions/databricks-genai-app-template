# Next.js Production Environment Variables
# These are used when building the Next.js app for production

# Backend API URL - FastAPI endpoint (server-side only, used during build)
# In Databricks Apps single-container deployment, FastAPI runs on localhost:8000
# Both Next.js and Python FastAPI run in the same container
BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000

# IMPORTANT: Do NOT set NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL in production!
# The frontend should use relative URLs (same origin) since FastAPI serves both frontend and API
